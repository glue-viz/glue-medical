        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Note that this plugin requires [glue](http://glueviz.org/) to be installed -
        see [this page](http://glueviz.org/en/latest/installation.html) for
        instructions on installing glue.
        
        In addition, this plugin requires the [GDCM](http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/) and
        [pydicom](http://pydicom.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) packages to be installed.
        If you are using conda, you can easily install these with:
        
            conda install -c conda-forge gdcm
            pip install https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom/archive/master.zip
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        To install the latest developer version of the plugin from the git
        repository, you can do:
        
            pip install https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-medical/archive/master.zip
        
        This will auto-register the plugin with Glue.
        
        Using
        -----
        
        At the moment, this plugin provides a reader for DICOM files. You can give
        glue either a DICOM file or a directory containing DICOM files. For example,
        you can start glue using:
        
            glue mydata.dcm
        
        or
        
            glue directory_with_dicom_files
        
        and you can also load files from inside glue. It is not yet possible to load
        a directory from the 'Open Data Set' menu in glue.
        
        At the moment, if all the shapes of the DICOM files match inside the directory,
        we combine the arrays into an array with a higher dimensionality (for example
        we combine 2d arrays into a single 3d array). In future, we will make it
        possible for users to control this behavior.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run the tests, do:
        
            py.test glue_medical
        
        at the root of the repository. This requires the [pytest](http://pytest.org)
        module to be installed.
